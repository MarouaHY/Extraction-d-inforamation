Iris Recognition System

This application allows users to perform iris recognition using the following steps:

    Image Import: The user imports an iris image from their computer.

    Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: The system preprocesses the image, extracts SIFT features of the iris.

    Comparison with Database: The extracted descriptors are compared with those in the database to find matches.

    Real-Time Display: The user interface displays the processing steps in real-time for better understanding.

    Recognition Result: If a match is found, the interface displays the index of the corresponding iris, along with the recognition decision: "Identified" or "Not identified".
